# Tech Blog
## Description

This app allows users to write blog posts to share with other users as well as comment on existing posts.

- My motivation for this app was to be able to make posts about tech and see what others have to say.
- I built this project to understand the MVC framework better.
- This solves the problem of users being able to put their thoughts about tech in a place to share with each other.
- I learned how the front end can interact with the back end in an MVC style app.
